# Space Invaders

## About
A crude version of space invaders created using phaserjs, a javascript library for creating games. The game itself is infinite and becomes more difficult as you progress and win more levels. You win a level by destroying all the enemy ships.

## Controls
Space bar - Shoot the enemy
Right arrow key - Move your ship to the right
Left arrow key - Move your ship to the left

## Disclaimer
In some cases an enemy attack may not directly hit your ship but you will still die. This is because the sprite used for the player ship was downsized. This is only a novel project I created within a few hours and I don\'t plan on fixing this issue.
